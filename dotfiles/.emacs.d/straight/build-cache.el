From Lisp code, SOURCES should be a subset of the symbols in
`straight-recipe-repositories'. Only those recipe repositories

recipe to the kill ring), `insert' (insert at point), or nil (no
action, just return it).

Optional arg FILTER must be a unary function.
It takes a package name as its sole argument.

of a recipe. (It is not possible to return an actual recipe, as the API
for `straight-get-recipe' returns MELPA-style recipes, while cached
recipes have already been converted into the internal format.)

MELPA-STYLE-RECIPE is either a symbol naming a package, or a list
whose car is a symbol naming a package and whose cdr is a
property list containing e.g. `:type', `:local-repo', `:files',
and VC backend specific keywords.

First, the package recipe is registered with straight.el. If
NO-CLONE is a function, then it is called with two arguments: the
package name as a string, and a boolean value indicating whether
the local repository for the package is available. In that case,
the return value of the function is used as the value of NO-CLONE
instead. In any case, if NO-CLONE is non-nil, then processing
stops here.

Otherwise, the repository is cloned, if it is missing. If
NO-BUILD is a function, then it is called with one argument: the
package name as a string. In that case, the return value of the
function is used as the value of NO-BUILD instead. In any case,
if NO-BUILD is non-nil, then processing halts here. Otherwise,
the package is built and activated. Note that if the package
recipe has a nil `:build' entry, then NO-BUILD is ignored
and processing always stops before building and activation
occurs.

CAUSE is a string explaining the reason why
`straight-use-package' has been called. It is for internal use
only, and is used to construct progress messages. INTERACTIVE is
non-nil if the function has been called interactively. It is for
internal use only, and is used to determine whether to show a
hint about how to install the package permanently.

Return non-nil when package is initially installed, nil otherwise.

Interactively, prompt with a list of available packages in currently
registered recipe repositories. With prefix arg, prompt first for which
recipe repository to list from. If a package has already been registered
in the current Emacs session, the existing recipe is re-used rather than
being looked up anew. With prefix arg, \"cache\" is displayed as one of
the recipe repositories, and allows filtering to only already-registered
packages.

:init            Code to run before PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.
:config          Code to run after PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.  Note that
                 if loading is deferred for any reason, this code does not
                 execute until the lazy load has occurred.
:preface         Code to be run before everything except `:disabled'; this
                 can be used to define functions for use in `:if', or that
                 should be seen by the byte-compiler.

:mode            Form to be added to `auto-mode-alist'.
:magic           Form to be added to `magic-mode-alist'.
:magic-fallback  Form to be added to `magic-fallback-mode-alist'.
:interpreter     Form to be added to `interpreter-mode-alist'.

:commands        Define autoloads for commands defined by the package.
                 This is useful if the package is being lazily loaded,
                 and you wish to conditionally call functions in your
                 `:init' block that are defined in the package.
:autoload        Similar to `:commands', but used for non-interactive functions.
:hook            Specify hook(s) to attach this package to.

:bind            Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands.
:bind*           Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands,
                 *overriding all minor mode bindings*.
:bind-keymap     Bind a key prefix to an auto-loaded keymap defined in the
                 package.  This is like `:bind', but for keymaps.
:bind-keymap*    Like `:bind-keymap', but overrides all minor mode bindings

:defer           Defer loading of a package -- this is implied when using
                 `:commands', `:bind', `:bind*', `:mode', `:magic', `:hook',
                 `:magic-fallback', or `:interpreter'.  This can be an integer,
                 to force loading after N seconds of idle time, if the package
                 has not already been loaded.
:demand          Prevent the automatic deferred loading introduced by constructs
                 such as `:bind' (see `:defer' for the complete list).

:after           Delay the effect of the use-package declaration
                 until after the named libraries have loaded.
                 Before they have been loaded, no other keyword
                 has any effect at all, and once they have been
                 loaded it is as if `:after' was not specified.

:if EXPR         Initialize and load only if EXPR evaluates to a non-nil value.
:disabled        The package is ignored completely if this keyword is present.
:defines         Declare certain variables to silence the byte-compiler.
:functions       Declare certain functions to silence the byte-compiler.
:load-path       Add to the `load-path' before attempting to load the package.
:diminish        Support for diminish.el (if installed).
:delight         Support for delight.el (if installed).
:custom          Call `Custom-set' or `set-default' with each variable
                 definition without modifying the Emacs `custom-file'.
                 (compare with `custom-set-variables').
:custom-face     Call `face-spec-set' with each face definition.
:ensure          Loads the package using package.el if necessary.
:pin             Pin the package to an archive.
:vc              Install the package directly from a version control system

This macro provides a compact way to write short `lambda' expressions.
It expands to a `lambda' expression, which calls the function FN with
arguments BODY and returns its value.  The arguments of the `lambda'
expression are derived from symbols found in BODY.

Each symbol from `%1' through `%9', which appears in an unquoted part
of BODY, specifies a mandatory argument.  Each symbol from `&1' through
`&9', which appears in an unquoted part of BODY, specifies an optional
argument.  The symbol `&*' specifies extra (`&rest') arguments.

The shorter symbol `%' can be used instead of `%1', but using both in
the same expression is not allowed.  Likewise `&' can be used instead
of `&1'.  These shorthands are not recognized in function position.

To support binding forms that use a vector as VARLIST (such as `-let'
from the `dash' package), argument symbols are also detected inside of
vectors.

The space between `##' and FN can be omitted because `##' is read-syntax
for the symbol whose name is the empty string.  If you prefer you can
place a space there anyway, and if you prefer to not use this somewhat
magical symbol at all, you can instead use the alternative name `llama'.

Instead of:

  (lambda (a &optional _ c &rest d)
    (foo a (bar c) d))

you can use this macro and write:

  (##foo %1 (bar &3) &*)

which expands to:

  (lambda (%1 &optional _&2 &3 &rest &*)
    (foo %1 (bar &3) &*))

Unused trailing arguments and mandatory unused arguments at the border
between mandatory and optional arguments are also supported:

  (##list %1 _%3 &5 _&6)

becomes:

  (lambda (%1 _%2 _%3 &optional _&4 &5 _&6)
    (list %1 &5))

Note how `_%3' and `_&6' are removed from the body, because their names
begin with an underscore.  Also note that `_&4' is optional, unlike the

Literate Haskell scripts are supported via `haskell-literate-mode'.
The variable `haskell-literate' indicates the style of the script in the
current buffer.  See the documentation on this variable for more details.

Use `haskell-version' to find out what version of Haskell mode you are
currently using.

Additional Haskell mode modules can be hooked in via `haskell-mode-hook'.

Indentation modes:

    `haskell-indentation-mode', Kristof Bastiaensen, Gergely Risko
      Intelligent semi-automatic indentation Mk2

    `haskell-indent-mode', Guy Lapalme
      Intelligent semi-automatic indentation.

Interaction modes:

    `interactive-haskell-mode'
      Interact with per-project GHCi processes through a REPL and
      directory-aware sessions.

Other modes:

    `haskell-decl-scan-mode', Graeme E Moss
      Scans top-level declarations, and places them in a menu.

    `haskell-doc-mode', Hans-Wolfgang Loidl
      Sets up eldoc to echo types of functions or syntax of keywords
      when the cursor is idle.

To activate a minor-mode, simply run the interactive command. For
example, `M-x haskell-doc-mode'. Run it again to disable it.

To enable a mode for every `haskell-mode' buffer, add a hook in
your Emacs configuration. To do that you can customize
`haskell-mode-hook' or add lines to your .emacs file. For
example, to enable `interactive-haskell-mode', use the following:

    (add-hook \\='haskell-mode-hook \\='interactive-haskell-mode)

Completion can be controlled with the commands:
`company-complete-common', `company-complete-selection', `company-complete',
`company-select-next', `company-select-previous'.  If these commands are
called before `company-idle-delay', completion will also start.

Completions can be searched with `company-search-candidates' or
`company-filter-candidates'.  These can be used while completion is
inactive, as well.

The completion data is retrieved using `company-backends' and displayed
using `company-frontends'.  If you want to start a specific backend, call
it interactively or use `company-begin-backend'.

backend chooses otherwise, or `company-transformers' changes it later.

The initial input is given by the INITIAL argument.  DIR can be nil, a

is called interactively with a prefix argument, the user can specify the
directories or files to search in.  Multiple directories or files must
be separated by comma in the minibuffer, since they are read via
`completing-read-multiple'.  By default the project directory is used if
`consult-project-function' is defined and returns non-nil.  Otherwise
the `default-directory' is searched.  If the command is invoked with a
double prefix argument (twice `C-u') the user is asked for a project, if
not yet inside a project, or the current project is searched.

The input string is split, the first part of the string (grep input) is
passed to the asynchronous grep process and the second part of the
string is passed to the completion-style filtering.

The input string is split at a punctuation character, which is given as
the first character of the input string.  The format is similar to
Perl-style regular expressions, e.g., /regexp/.  Furthermore command
line options can be passed to grep, specified behind --.  The overall
prompt input has the form `#async-input -- grep-opts#filter-string'.

Note that the grep input string is transformed from Emacs regular
expressions to Posix regular expressions.  Always enter Emacs regular
expressions at the prompt.  `consult-grep' behaves like builtin Emacs
search commands, e.g., Isearch, which take Emacs regular expressions.
Furthermore the asynchronous input split into words, each word must
match separately and in any order.  See `consult--regexp-compiler' for
the inner workings.  In order to disable transformations of the grep
input, adjust `consult--regexp-compiler' accordingly.

Here we give a few example inputs:

#alpha beta         : Search for alpha and beta in any order.
#alpha.*beta        : Search for alpha before beta.
#\\(alpha\\|beta\\) : Search for alpha or beta (Note Emacs syntax!)
#word -- -C3        : Search for word, include 3 lines as context
#first#second       : Search for first, quick filter for second.
